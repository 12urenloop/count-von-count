Integration testing
-------------------

count-von-count
===============

Count-von-count runs normally.


Bert
====

Instead of reporting to dr.beaker, count-von-count reports to Bert. Bert simply
counts all laps and also provides an `/overview` page, which gives the current
overview for the different teams in JSON.

Ernie
=====

Ernie generates input and sends it to count-von-count. Every once in a while, it
checks the `/overview` page of Bert, to see if the count generated by
count-von-count is as expected.
